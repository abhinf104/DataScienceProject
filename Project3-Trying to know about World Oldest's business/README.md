# What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses

## Overview

- This project involves the use of joining techniques to discover the oldest businesses in the world.

## Project Description

- The project aims to plan for the future and ensure that the business survives changing market conditions.
- Some businesses have done this remarkably well and have lasted for hundreds of years.
- In this project, we'll explore data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses.
- We'll investigate when these businesses were founded and which industries they belong to.

## Data Exploration

- Like many business problems, the data we'll explore is contained in several different datasets.
- To understand the world's oldest businesses, we will first need to use joining techniques to merge our data.
- From there, we can use manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.
