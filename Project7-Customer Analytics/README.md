# Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling

## Overview

- This project involves applying your knowledge of data types and categorical data to prepare a big dataset for modeling.

## Project Description

- Being able to create predictive models is very cool, but translating fancy models into real business value is a major challenge if the training data isn't stored efficiently.
- You've been hired by a major online data science training provider to store their data much more efficiently.
- The goal is to create a model that predicts if course enrollees are looking for a job.
- You'll convert data types, create ordered categories, and filter ordered categorical data so the data is ready for modeling.
