# My Data Science Projects

- **Overview**: This repository contains a collection of projects I have worked on while learning data science concepts. Each project is a demonstration of the skills and knowledge I have acquired.

- **Projects**:
  - **Project 1**: Analysis of 10000 apps from the Android App Market for insights into the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.
  - **Project 2**: Discovering whether movies are getting shorter over time by doing Exploratory Analysis on Netflix movies and 
  - **Project 3**: Performing Joining Techniques to discover the oldest businesses in the world to plan for the future and ensure that the company survives changing market conditions.
